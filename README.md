## PhantomHunt - Multiplayer Game ##

PhantomHunt is a strategic, turn-based 2D multiplayer game developed as part of the CS108 programming project. Experience thrilling chases inside a cursed castle where teamwork meets pure survival instinct.

## The Game Concept ##

In PhantomHunt, two unequal teams compete against each other: three ghosts versus one human. The setting: an unsuspecting human finds themselves inside a haunted castle. While the ghosts try to drive the intruder into madness, every second counts for the human trying to escape.

## Core Mechanics ##

**Asymmetric Gameplay:**
3 vs. 1 – each role has different abilities and objectives.

**Scoring System:**
- The human earns points by surviving as long as possible and successfully finishing a round.
- The ghosts earn points by locating and scaring the human.

**Fairness through rotation:**
A match consists of four rounds. Each player takes the role of the human exactly once. After the final round, the player with the highest total score wins the match.

## How to Start the Game

**Build the Executable Jar**
Before running the game, you need to compile the code and build the executable .jar file. Open your terminal in the root directory of the project and run:

**./gradlew jar**

**Run the Application**
Once the build is successful you can start the game via the terminal using the following syntax:

java -jar build/libs/phantom-hunt.jar *mode* and *port / address:port*

**Starting as a Server:**
To host a server, set the mode to server and specify the port you want to open.
For example:
**java -jar build/libs/phantom-hunt.jar server 2222**

**Starting as a Client:**
To join as a client, set the mode to client and provide the IP address and port of the host server.
For example:
**java -jar build/libs/phantom-hunt.jar client 192.168.1.9:2222**

## Running Tests and Quality Assurance

To ensure the stability and correctness of the game, we use automated testing and coverage tools. Open the terminal in the root directory to run the following commands.

**Execute Unit Tests:**
To run all automated tests, execute: 
**./gradlew test**
Once finished, view the detailed test results by executing 
**open build/reports/tests/test/index.html**.

**Generate Code Coverage Report (JaCoCo):**
To measure the line coverage of our test site, run: 
**./gradlew test jacocoTestReport**
The generated HTML report can be viewed by executing 
**open build/reports/jacoco/test/html/index.html**.
